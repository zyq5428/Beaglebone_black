## Supported boards

* [BeagleBone Black](#beaglebone-black)
* [BeagleBone Black Wireless](#beaglebone-black-wireless)
* [BeagleBone Blue](#beaglebone-blue)
* [BeagleBoard-xM](#beagleboard-xm)

## Supported scanners

* [Datalogic QuickScan L](http://www.datalogic.com/eng/products/automatic-data-capture/general-duty-handheld-scanners/quickscan-l-qd2300-pd-166.html) - VID:05f9 "PSC Scanning, Inc." PID:2204 
* [Intermec SG20 General Duty 1D/2D Handheld Scanner](http://www.intermec.com/products/scansg20t/) - VID:067E PID: 0801

## Software setup

For production, the boards should be flashed with an approved production image ahead of beginning this test. No additional software setup steps should be performed. The first 12 characters of the EEPROM should also be valid ahead of running this test, though the additional serial number characters need not and should not be programmed until this test is run.

If not already setup, on a recent [BeagleBoard.org Debian image](https://beagleboard.org/latest-images), perform:

    apt-get update
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y roboticscape
    cd /opt/source
    git clone https://github.com/jadonk/beagle-tester
    cd beagle-tester
    make && make install
    
## Serial number barcode format

Each board that has an on-board EEPROM should have an associated 16 digit serial number placed onto a barcode on the board.

The first 4 ASCII characters indicate the board type:

* BeagleBone Black - 00C0
* BeagleBone Black Wireless - BWA5
* BeagleBone Blue - BLA2

The second 4 characters should indicate the manufacturing week in the format YYWW, where YY is currently 16 and WW is currently 30.

The next 4 characters should be a manufacturer-specific product code. If you are a new manufacturer, please choose something unique you can use to identify your boards.

Allocations include, but are not limited to: 

* BBGW for GHI manufactured BeagleBone Black Wireless
* ELnn for Embest manufactured BeagleBone Blue

The final 4 characters are a sequential decimal number. If more than 10,000 boards are manufactured that week, roll over the top digit to an ASCII hex character.

6. Connect _scanner_
7. Wait for the CISPR test animation and audio playback (should be under 15 seconds) ![CISPR image][cispr]
8. Connect USB client port on _DUT_ to _host_
9. Scan the 16 character barcode
10. Pass or fail will be indicated by a respectively green or red box on the _TV_
11. Disconnect _scanner_
12. Disconnect _host_
13. Disconnect _power_
14. Disconnect remaining devices

# BeagleBone Black Wireless
